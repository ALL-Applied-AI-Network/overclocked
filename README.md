# Rockwell Automation + NVIDIA Innovation Lab · Fall 2026

This is your team's repository for the four-week physical AI hackathon run by Rockwell Automation, NVIDIA, the MSOE AI Club and UWM's Connected Systems Institute. Build everything here. Sponsors can follow your work as it progresses, and your final submission links straight to this repository.

**Full event guide** (datasets, compute, rules, judging, prizes): <https://msoe-maic.com/library/?article=Rockwell-NVIDIA-Fall-2026>
**Your team workspace** (team, repository access, submissions): <https://dashboard.all-ai-network.org/j/L36HEH>
**Questions:** [join the hackathon Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rockwellnvidi-wq82211/shared_invite/zt-4bp05nsn9-UW3afFtM9wjzWtZiQoJBHg) and ask in the channel that matches your question. The event guide's "Getting help" section says who to ping for what.

## First week

- [ ] Everyone on the team has an ALL AI Network account and has joined this team in the [workspace](https://dashboard.all-ai-network.org/j/L36HEH).
- [ ] Everyone has connected GitHub and accepted the repository invitation (check your GitHub email, or open the workspace and press the check button).
- [ ] Pick your dataset. We recommend one strong solution around a single dataset.
- [ ] Download the data and make sure everyone who needs it can open it.
- [ ] Read the compute guide and decide what you'll need.
- [ ] Join Slack, open `#hackathon-announcements`, and find your dataset's channel.
- [ ] Submit the [team plan](https://dashboard.all-ai-network.org/s/V28NHK) by Wednesday, October 14. It's a short resource request, not a graded paper, and any teammate can update it before the deadline.

## The three datasets

1. **[Final Vial Inspection](https://msoe-maic.com/library?article=Rockwell-NVIDIA-Fall-2026-Vial-Inspection):** find missing caps, crooked caps, damaged vials and unexpected empty positions after the robot fills a fixture.
2. **[Fluid Mixing Station 3](https://msoe-maic.com/library?article=Rockwell-NVIDIA-Fall-2026-Fluid-Mixing):** use synchronized camera views to detect fill and color problems caused by recipes and fluid carryover.
3. **[Grasping and Sorting](https://msoe-maic.com/library?article=Rockwell-NVIDIA-Fall-2026-Grasping-Sorting):** use a digital twin and multiple cameras to make a standalone FANUC arm grasp and sort objects more reliably.

## Read before your team plan

- **[Compute: Brev, DGX Spark and build.nvidia.com](https://msoe-maic.com/library?article=Rockwell-NVIDIA-Fall-2026-Compute).** Brev credits are spent whenever an instance is running, so stop instances you aren't using.
- **[Collect and test your own data](https://msoe-maic.com/library?article=Rockwell-NVIDIA-Fall-2026-Data-Collection):** visits, extra data, digital twins, and booking a supervised test on the real equipment.
- **[Tools and resources](https://msoe-maic.com/library?article=Rockwell-NVIDIA-Fall-2026-Resources):** AI coding tools, vision-language models, NVIDIA Cosmos and more. Start with a simple baseline.

## Final submission (Sun Nov 1)

- A video of about five minutes
- A one-page project summary
- A link to this repository
- References and credits for data, models, code and tools

## Working in this repository

```bash
git clone <this repository's URL from the green "Code" button>
```

- Commit early and push often. Mentors and judges see what's here.
- **Don't commit large datasets or model weights.** Keep them out with `.gitignore` and note in this README where to download them.
- Before the finals, replace this README with your project: the problem, your approach, results, how to run it, and credits.

**Can't push or see this repository?** Open the [team workspace](https://dashboard.all-ai-network.org/j/L36HEH) and press the GitHub check button. If it still doesn't work, ping Brett Storoe in `#hackathon-general` on Slack.
